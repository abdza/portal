Welcome to Java Portal Framework's documentation!
=================================================

The Java Portal Framework(JPF) is a framework for creating dynamic and easy to update portal that has 
complicated and customized workflow and processes.

It consists of the following components:
  - Pages
  - Files
  - Trees
  - Trackers

A JPF module consists of one or more of those components. User permission is based on modules. A user might 
be an Admin for one module but just a normal user in another. Thus the user can make updates to the modules 
they are Admin of but only view or download information from modules where they are only users.
